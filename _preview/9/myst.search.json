Simply navigate your mouse to\nthe top right corner of the book chapter you are viewing and click\non the rocket ship icon, (see figure below), and be sure to select\n“launch Binder”. After a moment you should be presented with a\nnotebook that you can interact with. I.e. you’ll be able to execute\nand even change the example programs. You’ll see that the code cells\nhave no output at first, until you execute them by pressing\nShift+Enter. Complete details on how to interact with\na live Jupyter notebook are described in \n\nGetting Started with\nJupyter.\n\nNote, not all Cookbook chapters are executable.
